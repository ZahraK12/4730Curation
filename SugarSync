SugarSync is an online database server that my company, MAS Values uses. 
MAS Values, Multifamiliy Appraisal Specialists Values, holds several years of my company's research on apartment properties in Texas. 
Some expectations employees follow when using SugarSync is uploading information to the appropriate folder and labeling uploaded files correctly.
Each project folder have the same framework. This consistancy in organization make older files easier to access.
